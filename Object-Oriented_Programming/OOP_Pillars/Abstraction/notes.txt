My beautiful blue house on a quaint pond has running water, electricity, and gas- but 
you do not need to know how each of these things works. Instead, you flip a light switch 
and the lights come on; You turn the stove on and a blue circle of flame gently rolls upward; 
You push the faucet handle up and a stream of clear water pours out. The house's walls and 
foundation abstract away the details of how these things work, and you as my guest enjoy them 
blissfully unaware of long lengths of wire, deeply buried pipes, and large water tanks that 
provide you with these amenities. Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real 
implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only how to use the application.
