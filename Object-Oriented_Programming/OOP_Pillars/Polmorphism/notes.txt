The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same 
function name is used for different types. When we previously used inheritance, we explicitly 
linked parent classes to child classes to write reusable code. Polymorphism is achieving the 
same outcome of shared properties and methods but there is no link between the code; instead, 
we write the properties and methods to operate in similar and logical ways, allowing us to 
freely swap classes and methods and being able to expect a similar output.
