We define a function called outer_function() and nest another function inside it called 
inner_function(). To generate a namespace, functions must be executed, so we are calling 
both of them.


Here, The outer_function() serves the role of an enclosing function while inner_function is 
an enclosed function. By creating this structure, we generate an enclosing namespace 
- a namespace created by an enclosing function and any number of enclosed functions inside it.

While Python doesnâ€™t give us any particular function like enclosing() to visualize the namespace, 
we can use locals() to see when enclosed namespaces are generated.
